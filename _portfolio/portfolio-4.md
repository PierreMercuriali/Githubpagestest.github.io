excerpt: "The project [Factory-in-a-day](http://www.factory-in-a-day.eu/) aims at improving the competitiveness of European manufacturing SMEs by removing the primary obstacle for robot automation: installation time and installation cost. <br/><img src='http://www.factory-in-a-day.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Factory-in-a-day_banner-1170x424.jpg'>"

The objective of this project is to marginalize the system integration cost by reducing the system integration time to one single day. The resultant 50% price reduction of fully integrated systems is not even the main effect. The really significant impact will be that the SME’s no longer have to earn back the investment through only one of their short production batches. In one day, the machines can be re-installed for another temporary product line and continue to be useful. Moreover, this opens up the possibility that the robots and other machinery are provided under short-term lease contracts to the SME’s, bringing the investment risk down to zero.
